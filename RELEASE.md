# Releasing the dashboard

## Steps

1. [Update version number](#updating-version-number)
1. [Manual testing](#manual-testing) of the master branch
1. [Tagging](#tagging) the release to deploy

### Updating version number

Numbers are chosen based on whether the code changes will cause a breaking API
change or not. Version numbers do not follow traditional semver, as this
codebase isn't a library that's consumed but a user interface. Instead, breaking
api changes should be a major change while all other changes can be a minor
change. Single bug fixes can be reserved for patch changes.

Once a version number is decided, it must be updated in `package.json` under
the `version` key. This is currently the only place it has to be updated. To
change the version:

1. Change the `version` key in `package.json` to the new version number.
1. Checkout a new branch with the format `release-{num}` where {num} is the new version number.
1. Commit the change with a message about updating for a new release.
1. Push this change up to the remote and create a pull request.
1. Once ready, merge the pull request (this will not trigger a release yet).

### Manual testing

Currently, the site does not have visual regression testing so must be manually
tested for breaking visual changes. Here is a simple script to assist in manual
testing. Generally, it's best to look through all the pages and check if
anything looks off. Testing should generally be done on the staging environment,
[dashboard-staging.fr.cloud.gov](https://dashboard-staging.fr.cloud.gov/),
when all the necessary code is on the master branch and has been deployed. To
check that the master branch has been deployed, check [Circle
CI](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/cg-dashboard).

#### Script

Actions in the script should be done under the `cf-deck-testing` organization
and the `testSpace01` space.

  - Click "Delete route".
  - Ensure the route is deleted.
1. Click on the `Overview` link in the sidenav and ensure the homepage appears.

## Tagging

Once the site looks OK and ready to deploy, tagging a commit in git will trigger
the deploy process to production, dashboard.cloud.gov.

On the master branch:

1. Ensure you have the most up to date code by pulling or rebasing.
1. Tag the commit by running `git tag -a {num}` where {num} is the new version number
1. Push the tag up to the remote by running `git push origin --tags`

This should start the release process which can be monitored in travis CI.
